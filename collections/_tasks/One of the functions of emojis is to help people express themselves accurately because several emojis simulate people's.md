Emojis functions as an extension of words in that they are vivid and easy to use when people communicating on the Internet. With emojis, people can express their feelings in a intuitive way.



I have to say that I really love to use emojis in my daily life. For one thing, using them properly can ease the tension when talking about something awkward with others on the Internet.
